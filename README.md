It seems like end-point <base_url>/emails/{id} does not work.
That is why I mocked data-source and service to retrieve data from and put in data as well.
If end-point worked, I would use "React Query" library. I skipped styles, "draftjs.org/"
for text area and some other issues due to lack of time.
